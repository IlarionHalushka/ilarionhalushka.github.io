    Why do companies think that I have time to complete a test task?
    What if I am considering 10 different companies and all of them ask to do a test task in addition to multiple rounds of interviews?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Why do companies think that I have time to complete a test task?
What if I am considering 10 different companies and all of them ask to do a test task in addition to multiple rounds of interviews?

## Why I Will Not Do Test Task?
* market is hot. Many companies are ready to make an offer without a test task.
* don't want to waste my time.
* it's boring.
* I have more important things to do.

## What Does Test Task Check?
* checks skills??
* checks if candidate is **not valuing his time**.
* checks if candidate is **willing to work for free**.
* proves that **candidate has no other better offers**.

## What Test Task Can Not Check?
* if the task was completed independently. I confess that I personally help my friends with test tasks.
* real life coding skills.
* collaboration/communication skills.
* thought process/stress resistance.

## Who Ought To Do Test Task?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trainee/intern/junior level candidates that have no real life experience. 
For them it's an option to show off their skills of googling and finding the right answers on the web.
Or simply entry level candidates do not have other option but to follow the process :(

## What Kind Of Test Task I Would Do?
* paid.
* interesting (maybe new technologies).
* real life (fixing or refactoring some production code).

## Alternative Ways Of Validating Skills?
* live coding during interview.
* reviewing github projects/open source contributions.
* checking stackoverflow answers.

**Time is money. Money is time.**
