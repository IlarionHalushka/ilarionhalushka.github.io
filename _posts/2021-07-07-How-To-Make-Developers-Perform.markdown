* Make them commit.
* Ask “when”, “why”.
* Load them with many tasks.
* Promise them golden beaches (show the carrot).
* Once they are done, don't let them catch their breath.
* Work in sprints and push extra hard to the end of the sprint.


* Make them feel guilty.
* Make them set estimates.
* Make them feel heroes who are saving the world.
* Set as many and as tight deadlines as possible.
* Find an exemplary employee/team and mention him as an example.
* Mention that users are struggling and waiting for the feature/fix asap.


* Set cameras in the office.
* Give them clock-in/out passes.
* Make them work from the office.
* Install time trackers/screenshoters.
* Setup software for tracking how many lines of code and tasks they completed.

## I Am Not A Manager.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not read any books about managing people and
tuning the performance of the team up. I have never been a manager (mentorship and leadership initiatives don't count).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following bullet points are based on the observations throughout my career.
I feel like most of the managers read the same books/articles/courses and have the same methods.

## Perform Or Demotivate?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some points from below really help me perform better,
but most of them are really demotivating. Be careful when introducing some techniques to not demotivate the team.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love freedom and less management standing over my shoulders.
Maybe those perfect ~~slaves~~ employees who need control, will perform better when you arrange every point from below.
