&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you work from home, you tend to show results.
When from the office, you might feel like you are working, but in fact not showing good results.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to measure the average time you spend
actually working from home and from the office.
Personally for me it's on **average 1 hour more work when from home** :thinking-face:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun fact: I heard that some companies make employees go to the office
to prevent them from working two full-time jobs :)

## Pros

#### Professional
* discuss technology news;
* build relations with peers/management;
* meet people from other departments;
* more focused on work, not disturbed by family;
* share experience;
* gain experience;
* easier and faster to debug/solve problems;

#### Personal
* build communication skills;
* get out of comfort zone;
* more emotions and laugh;
* mental and emotional health improvement;
* motivation to groom self;


* meet people on the way to the office;
* physical activity on the way to the office;
* explore new places\restaurants near the office;
* be up to date with news in team/company/city/country;
* easier to join some sports section, as you already left cozy home in the morning :) ;


## Cons
* time for commuting;
* time for getting dressed, etc.;
* get disturbed by colleagues;
* hard to conduct meetings with remote team members, no privacy;
* useless small talks;
* more time spent on lunch;
* more stress;
* no siesta time if required;
* decrease in productivity (IMHO).


## Balance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To balance out the pros and cons of working from the office vs. working from home
I incline to promote the hybrid approach - 30-40% office and 60-70% home.
