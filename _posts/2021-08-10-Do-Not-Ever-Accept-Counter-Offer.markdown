## Reasons Of Not Accepting Counter Offer.

* Probably, **compensation is not the only reason** why you decided to consider other companies.
If you accept counter offer, those things that bother you will stay.
  
* Trust is gone. You will be **marked as "not dedicated employee"**. Guess who will be the first during staff reduction?
 Guess for which role employer will place an open vacancy?

* You should **forget about promotions**.


* You might **feel like you lost a good opportunity** when you have not joined another company.
However, same feeling may appear if new place is worse than previous.
  
* Possibly the tasks that you will get assigned to won't be that interesting, because again - you are "not dedicated employee".

* You will feel like you betrayed the company, when forced to make them give you a counter offer.
