## Maths. Decision Theory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there are multiple options (offers), and the decision has to be made based on some criteria,
the scientific way to solve this problem is to use Decision Theory.

## Criteria Assessment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, all criteria have different importance (weight). Moreover, the importance may differ for each individual.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So to compare criteria of different importance a simple calculation has to be performed:

```criteria grade (CG) = importance * value```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The optimal options for importance and value are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, **Career Growth** has critical importance (4) for a candidate
 and company provides excellent growth opportunities (5), then: 
 
```criteria grade (CG) = 4 * 5 = 20```

## Evaluation of 1 offer

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all criteria grades are being calculated it's time to evaluate each offer:

```offer grade (OG) = SUM(CG) / N```

where `SUM(CG)` is the sum of all criteria grades (CG) and `N` is the total count of criteria considered.

## Comparing Offers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last step is just to sort offer grades in descending order and the top offer will be the first on the list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple example table with formulas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FxxJnf5xfQh8zEDunn90jcqkF2UM8rv2e9bo47EbXLQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest you make a thorough research on the companies that you are considering as the next workplace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spend half of our conscious life at work, so it's better to spend a few extra days analyzing options and making sure it's the right decision.
 
**The right decision at the right time upon your choice can make your life like flowers; otherwise, it will be as thorns. The first one you will enjoy, and the other one you have to bear.**
