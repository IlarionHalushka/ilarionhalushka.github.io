&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't talk about why it's important to choose a workplace and how your whole life depends on one decision.

## Who it may concern

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are a professional in your field, and the job market is hot, which means you can easily get multiple offers.
Even if there are only 2 companies which sent you an offer, you may find this article useful.

## Maths. Decision Theory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there are multiple options (offers), and the decision has to be made based on some criteria,
the scientific way to solve this problem is to use Decision Theory.

## Criteria to consider

* **Salary**
* **Remote**: yes/partly/no
* **Company Type**: product/outsource/outstaff/start-up
* **Company Reputation**
* **Project**: ongoing/new/legacy
* **Project Complexity**: easy/moderate/complex
* **Team professionalism**: juniors/middles/seniors
* **Tech Stack**: modern, outdated
* **Career growth**: slow/normal/fast
* **Team size**: small/medium/large
* **Development processes**: poor/ok/good
* **Overtimes**: no/sometimes/yes, paid/unpaid
* **Bureaucracy**: no/bearable/unbearable
* **Location**: 30m/1h/1h30m
* **Vacations and holidays**: 20/30, paid/unpaid 
* **Relocation package**
* **Signing bonus**
* **Medical insurance**: no/cheap/good
* **Conferences, Sport compensation**: no/yes

## Criteria assessment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, all criteria have different importance (weight).
Moreover, the importance may differ for each individual.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So to compare criteria of different importance a simple calculation has to be performed:

```criteria grade (CG) = importance * value```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The optimal options for importance and value are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, **Career Growth** has critical importance (4) for a candidate
 and company provides excellent growth opportunities (5), then: 
 
```criteria grade (CG) = 4 * 5 = 20```

## Evaluation of 1 offer

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all criteria grades are being calculated it's time to evaluate each offer:

```offer grade (OG) = SUM(CG) / N```

where `SUM(CG)` is the sum of all criteria grades (CG) and `N` is the total count of criteria considered.

## Comparing offers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last step is just sort offer grades in descending order
and top offer will be the first on the list.


## Excel example

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple example table with formulas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FxxJnf5xfQh8zEDunn90jcqkF2UM8rv2e9bo47EbXLQ/edit?usp=sharing).
Just make a copy of the sheet, fill your criteria values and importance,
 and it will do the calculations.
 

## Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest you to make a thorough research on the companies that you are considering as the next work place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We spend half of our conscious life at work, so it's better to spend a few extra days analysing options and making sure it's the right decision.
 
**The right decision at the right time upon your choice can make your life like flowers; otherwise, it will be as thorns. The first one you will enjoy, and the other one you have to bear.**
