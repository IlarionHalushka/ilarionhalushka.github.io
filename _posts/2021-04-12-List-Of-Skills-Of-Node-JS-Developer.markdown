## Incomplete Existing Roadmap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a great [developer roadmap](https://github.com/aliyr/Nodejs-Developer-Roadmap),
but still I feel like many important things are missing from it.

## Gain Language/Framework Independent Knowledge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, everyone should learn things that are language and framework independent.
I saw developers which have limited knowledge of C.Sc. and focusing their knowledge toward 1 framework.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the past of IT world, I noticed that languages change, frameworks change, but 
basic C.Sc., architecture approaches, networks, databases, paradigms, testing, design patterns stay the same. 
For example in front-end world 10 years ago no one could expect that instead of jquery everyone would move to
Angular, React and Vue. It's hard to tell what will happen in 10 years.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like learning Maths and then applying it to other sciences. 
Maths has not changed in centuries.
Same in programming - learn language/framework 
independent things and then apply them to some state-of-the-art language and framework.

## Basic C.Sc. Knowledge:
* Data Structures
* Algorithms
* Security [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
* Git
* Debugging
* UML, block schemas
* Bash
* Unix systems

* Cryptography
* Authentication techniques
* Clean Code practices

## Networking
* HTTP/S
* Web sockets
* Long polling

* Queue (SQS, RabbitMQ)
* Stream (Kinesis, Kafka)
* Pub/sub

## Architecture:
