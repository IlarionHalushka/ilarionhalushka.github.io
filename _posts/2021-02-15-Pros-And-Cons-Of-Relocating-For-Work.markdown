  Sharing my own thoughts and feelings on benefits and disadvantages of relocating for work.
  Definitely there is no 100% right or wrong, lots depends on context and your priorities.
  It's everyone's personal responsibility to decide if one wants to relocate and if they will be happier there.

## Personal Experience of Relocating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived and worked in two foreign countries for 4 and 3 months. 
Now I would like to share my own view on relocation. 
As professional sales managers do - I will start from pros, and then follow with cons.

## Pros
* Expanding comfort zone.
* Learning/improving **language**.
* Improving **quality of life**.
* Getting more money (questionable, because also spending more).
* Meeting **new people**.
* Learning **new culture**.
* Meeting **new friends**.
* Finding your passion.
* Running away from your past.
* Traveling, exploring **new places**.

## Cons
* Feeling alien/guest worker.
* **No family**.
* **No friends**.
* **No old beloved places**.
* Risks related to failing probation period.
* Learning to pretend that you became happier abroad.
* Showing your fellas who stayed home that you are better than they are.

* Stress.
* Lose of stability.
* Risk of visa rejections, rejection of extending visa.
* Convincing yourself that you like it there more than at home.
* Learning new skill of assimilation into new culture, pretending you are one of “them”.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Spouse and children will also suffer from integration into the new world. 
  They will at least need to learn the language. 
  Spouse will need to find a job and kids adjust to new schools/friends. 
  Chances are that some family members **won’t fit into new community** and feel desperate.
  **Don't be egoistic, think about your family too.**

## For Now, I will Stay

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not going to talk you to relocate or not.
Definitely my points do not always make sense, lots depends on context.
I am just trying to help with considering many aspects of relocating and finding what's right for your life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for now, I have no plans to relocate. Time will show - if a good opportunity arises
then it's probably worth a try, especially while still young and have no family.
