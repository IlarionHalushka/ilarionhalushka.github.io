**You can work overtime for a day, for a week, maybe a month, not more.
If overtime becomes the new normal for you then eventually your productivity drops and YOU BURN OUT...**

````
Are YOU skilled enough to fulfill your responsibilities
during working hours without overtime?
````

## Have You Ever Spent Evenings or Weekends Working for "Thank you"?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bet you felt that strange feeling inside you.
When you are tired, when your partner is already in bed, **when your eyes are burning,
when you stop feeling your neck and back**...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You keep on working, you feel like it's your duty, 
you are the **superhero who will same the team** and push the last fixes right before the deadline.
Then you feel like the relief will come, and you will be **standing on the pedestal holding a golden medal**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That doesn't happen, though.
Maximum what you get is an extra day off or just a "thank you" from your manager.
Now go and divide those extra hours you worked overtime by the amount of "thanks" you get 
- that is your income for working overtime.


## The Infinite Loop of the Top Performer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interesting thing about this working pattern is that **the more you work the more they expect from you**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will be the first one to be asked to work at the night duty or make a release after working hours?
Will it be the top performer who dedicates his personal time to go an extra mile or the one who goes offline exactly at 6pm?
I think the answer is obvious. **Why be top performer?** :thinking-face:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The companies have developed

to the maximum possible limit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Don't calculate how much money you make a month or a year, calculate how much you make an hour.**


## Why NOT Work Overtime?
* Management changes/new owners -> possibly you don’t like them, or they don't like you.
* One day you may get fired. Out of nowhere. Just wake up and have no access to slack and mail.
* Makes you lock yourself from new opportunities.
  

* Business may go down. Crisis in this field, in the world, competitors succeed.
* From my experience it's hard to get a decent salary increase within one company. 
  Much likely someone on the side will propose you better compensation.
* Company opens a new niche/project and old one becomes obsolete.


* Your expertise sticks to one tech stack and similar problems.
* Usually, tech stack doesn't get updated, but the world of tech evolves much faster.
* The more management feels that you need this job, the more work they will put on your shoulders. 
  That’s the law.


## Time Goes By. You Forget Each Other.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember those times when I was working hard on previous projects. 
One day I parted ways with those companies. The next day I was not needed, they forgot about me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I also moved on. 
Sometimes I recall all that hard work, overtimes, dedication, worries, stress... 
Now I think that was just a waste of my energy and time to work extra hard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's interesting is that with each new company that I joined it was better, than previous one. 
It's a good luck or experience of choosing

## Exceptions. Why You Should Work Overtime.
* You simply love it.
* You don't have personal life or hobbies.
* This is your company.
* You don't have ambitions.
* You have equity stakes at current company.
* **You gain a precious experience** you need to advance in your career.


* Long term contract.
* Company will threaten you if you leave.
* You have no other options on the market.
* You are not skilled enough to apply for a better position.
* The only your friends you have got are your colleagues, 
  with whom you built close relations.


**You have to work as many hours as much you are paid.**
