title: Why Testers Hate Developers
date: 2021-02-24
description: |
    I have been to both sides: working as QA and Developer. I know how hard it is for QA Engineer to
    work with unprofessional developers. I confess that as Developer sometimes I act unprofessionally, 
    but at least trying to get better.

## I have been on both sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the beginning of my career in IT I was working as Manual QA and then Automation QA.
I still remember how frustrating it is to work with unprofessional and not responsible developers.

## Situations I hated when working with developers as QA Engineer
* Said deployed code when in fact not.
* Asked to check small fix instead of checking it himself.
* Deployed a critical feature at last hour of working day.
* Fixed one thing - broke 5 other places.
* Fixed a bug in one place when it occurs on 10 other pages too.
* Fixes related bugs one by one and asks to test them asap instead of fixing all together.
* Notified about refactoring which requires regression testing.
* Says it’s fixed but page can’t even open.
* Fights that bug is a feature.
* Pushed a feature for testing without checking happy paths.
* Pushes new changes after a feature was fully tested.
* No time for testing feature before release because developers haven’t finished on time.
  
## Phrases I hated
* "It works locally (on other env)."
* "Can you try again? I will check logs."
* "That wasn't a part of product specs."
* "Why did you wait so long to find this issue? Why you have not found this earlier?"
* "I won’t fix it. This bug is not related to my changes. It’s already in production."

## Unprofessional developers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that problems mentioned above come from indifference and
unresponsible attitude to work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good book that makes developers think about their behavior is Clean Coder.

## Confession
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time went by, I gained more experience in a role of developer. 
At some point I started noticing myself doing things which I knew from previous experience
were frustrating for our QA engineers. It's some interesting psychology.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the fact I have been to both sides of the table, I know how hard it is for tester
to work with unprofessional developers. So I am trying to catch myself, stop and think about my actions
and how to at least annoy QAs less than other developers :0
