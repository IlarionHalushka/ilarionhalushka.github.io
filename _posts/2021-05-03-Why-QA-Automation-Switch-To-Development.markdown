## Intro.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I went through the path of QA Manual -> QA Automation -> Developer.
In this article I want to share my thoughts of pros and cons of switching to development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever heard of a developer who switched to QA Automation or QA Manual? I have not.
However, I still don't consider the path from QA to Developer as a natural career advancement.
These are two different careers and one can go either path. Let's compare the pros and cons.

## Pros of Switching to Development.
* More interesting tasks.
* Better compensation.
* Can build start-up with development skills.
* More relocation possibilities.
* More skilled peers.
* Never need to help manual QAs.
* If test automation will be done by programs, developers will still stick a few more years :)
* Options of choosing a company.
* Developer can do what QA does but QA canâ€™t do what developer does.
* Less routine.
* More career growth opportunities.
* More independence.

## Cons of Switching to Development.
* More responsibilities.
* More stress/pressure.
* More hours of work.
* More skills to learn.

## Myths.
* Only the best QAs can switch to development.
* Development is the next career step for QAs.
* Developers don't have routine tasks.

## To switch, or not to switch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though you lose some money, time, go out of comfort zone - it's still worth it
and will pay off later in the future. At any point you can get back to testing, if you don't like development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I would go my career path again, the thing that I would change is - 
switch to development earlier.
