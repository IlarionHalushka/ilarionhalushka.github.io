&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people find it unusual when someone speaks multiple languages. 
In my case it's 4 languages: 2 native - Ukrainian, Russian, and 2 foreign - English, German.

Speaking multiple languages makes you a diversified person and makes you look differently this world.
It also opens doors to new opportunities and gives you many advantages in life.

## When someone asks me "How did you learn...?"

— How did you learn two foreign languages?

— Well, please name 10 possible ways how one can learn a language.

— Ok.
 * Sign up for a course.
 * Learn at school(university).
 * Hire a tutor.
 * Watch movies
 * Read books.
 * Youtube courses.
 * Educational mobile apps.
 * Talking with native speakers.
 * Listening to music.
 * Surround yourself with target language: translate a phone, PC, etc.
 * Take notes.
 * Create a dictionary.

— Yes!

— What "yes"?

— Yes! I did all that you mentioned.


## Persistence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting fact is during such a conversation no one talks about persistence in learning.
Since I am 16 y.o. I learn every single day. Even if it's only 5-10 minutes a day it still counts.


**Learning a language is not a sprint, it's a marathon.**


## Learn as kids do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kid sees a ball 1st time and hears "ball" but has no idea (association) what it is. 
When kid plays a ball 10-50-100 times and hears same word in a similar situation then it starts to associate playing a ball with the word "ball".
The process of learning is absolutely same for adults.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's why I think it's important to surround yourself with the target language as much as possible:
* translate your phone, PC.
* listen to music.
* watch series.
* google using target language.
* read articles.
* if you are a fan of social media - subscribe to foreign influencers.
* if you are a fan of video games - join foreign teams.

## Not an act, but a habit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you think that you can learn a language and mark it as completed achievement [x].
I am here to disappoint you that it's a wrong assumption.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Once you mark it as complete [x] and quit learning, the knowledge slowly fades away. Similar logic applies to training muscles.
You have to accept that learning a language should become your habit and stick forever.

## Enjoy the process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All human beings have an innate instinct called laziness, which is tightly connected
to procrastination. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways to fight laziness but in this article I will just say that you have to enjoy the learning process.
There is no silver bullet that will help you learn a language in a few months.
However, if you combine learning with joy - the habit is more likely to stick with you.
