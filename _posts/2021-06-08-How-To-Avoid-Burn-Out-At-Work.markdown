title: How To Avoid Burn Out At Work

    I do NOT believe that the one who loves what he is doing will ever get a burn out.
    If you don't love what you do you can say that you burned out and try to mask the symptoms 
    instead of treating the root cause.

## Burn Out is a Lie?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe there is no such thing as burn out.
* If you do things that you don’t love, sad news - you are already burned :(**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, if you do things that you love you will not burn out ever.
If you feel like you are about to burn - it’s a great time to reconsider the job that you do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are an employee, maybe your passion is writing books, or teaching kids
or building your own business, or writing a blog, or whatever your heart is willing.

## Small Periodic Burn-outs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this world nothing is a constant value. One day you feel excited about the work that you do.
The next day you are not willing to do anything. Then next week you are ok. And that cycle repeats with some period.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is absolutely normal and doesn't mean that you have a burn-out. 
You can't always feel "excellent". 
**If you feel excellent everyday then in a few weeks that level of excellence will become a routine.**
We always want more than what we've got.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So small ups and downs of your mood and motivation are acceptable.

## Maybe It's Not Burn-out?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask yourself these questions:
* Do I get enough sleep?
* When was the last time I checked my health condition?
* Do I fulfill the needs of lower levels of the Maslow Pyramid?

## Treating Symptoms Of ~~Burn Out~~ Not Loving What You Do.
* Go on vacation.
* Travel.
* Find a hobby, not coding related.
* Find love.
* Relocate.
* Create children.
* Start pet project.
* Get more challenging tasks.
* Change responsibilities.
* Change team.
* Change project.
* Change the tech stack.
* Change occupation.
* Start a business.
* You name it.
