## Filtering out the Students
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In every school I studied I saw that it's a pleasure for a teacher to teach someone who is eager to learn. 
Luckily my course was an act of volunteering, so I could filter out the students in order to avoid lazy ones.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were more than 5 people who wanted to study at my
<a target="_blank" href="/Results-Of-My-IT-Courses">course</a>,
and most did not complete the first task: 
read "Testing Dot Com" book and note important terms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was actually a test of how serious they were about studying. 
Most never completed first task -->> filtering worked :)

## Study Approach

0. **Questions** session regarding last lection and homework (10-30 minutes).
1. **Lection** (1-4 hours).
2. **Homework** - list of articles, books, podcasts related to current lection (5-25 hours).

## Topics Covered in Course
