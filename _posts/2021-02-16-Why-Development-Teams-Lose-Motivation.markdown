#### We all lose motivation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Level of motivation is never a constant value. It is an always changing value which
depends on numerous factors which I tried to gather in this article.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do accept that there are times when my level of motivation goes tremendously down. 
Most of the factors below I have experienced myself or have seen in teams that I worked with.

#### Processes in company
* daily chores instead of automated process.
* never ending deadlines.
* stressful daily work.
* unclear requirements.
* ever changing requirements.
* no one listens to opinions of developer.
* frequent switch of context (tasks).

#### Management
* micro management.
* [seagull management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagull_management).
* unclear hierarchy - no one knows who is responsible for what.

#### Schedule
* rigid schedule.
* overtimes.
* frequent night duty calls.
* no opportunity to work remotely.
* difficulty of taking vacation/sick leave/day off.

#### Code
* poorly written code.
* poor architecture.
* no tests.
* items above lead to - always breaking somewhere where you didn't expect it to break.

#### Finances
* salary below market value.
* no performance reviews.
* unclear performance review criteria.
* no compensation for meeting deadline or going extra mile.

#### Professional growth
* same repetitive routine tasks.
* boring features that make no sense.
* unprofessional team.
* no one else strives for better code quality.
* never ending bug fixing instead of development of new features.
* supporting system instead of developing.

#### Personal
* personal problems at home.
* health problems.
* no vacation.
* became insolent/arrogant (usually happens with Senior developers).
* no reason to finish on time or work extra mile because salary is same
  on months when you work 200 hours and when 100.
* no feedback about impact of feature.
* doesn't feel like software has any purpose.
* fear of losing job.
* have no positive feedback from peers.
* company cares more about hours spent in front of screen, than about delivery of results.
* burn out.
