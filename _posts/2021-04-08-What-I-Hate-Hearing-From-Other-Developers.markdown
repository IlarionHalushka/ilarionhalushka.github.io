title: What I Hate Hearing From Other Developers
date: 2021-04-08
description: |
    I worked in multiple teams on multiple projects.
    As the projects and teams changed I could notice same behaviour patterns of my peers.
    Some of them I liked and adopted, some of them I hate.
    Here I share a small list of the phrases that I hate to hear from my peers.

* "I introduced breaking changes, let others fix that."
* "My task broke because of them/him/her."
* "I will try". You either do or do not do, there is no "try".
* "I know we are not going to meet deadlines, let's see what will happen."
* "That's not my responsibility." or "I don't want to work on this."
* "I know this code is a mess, 
  but I won't refactor it because it's not me who wrote it."
* "I don't have time to write tests."
* "I don't care about end users, it's not my responsibility.
  I have requirements specification."
* "Let testers test it. It's their job."
