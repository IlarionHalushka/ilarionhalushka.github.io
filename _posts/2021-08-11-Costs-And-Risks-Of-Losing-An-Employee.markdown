## Costs.
* **Finding replacement may take from 1 to 12 months**, depending on seniority and job market.
* **Time of engineers/managers on interviewing** new candidates.
* **Money on recruitment activities**.
* Equipment, accesses, tools, documentation, forms, calendars, etc.
* **Other employees may lose motivation** if ex-employee was a good colleague/friend.
* **Educating the new employee** the same things that you taught ex-employee - 1-6 month.
  

* While looking for replacement you need to find someone to fulfill the duties of the ex-employee.
* Waiting for new the employee to **get familiar with existing project** may take 1-12 months, 
depending on project complexity and age.
* New developer 100% won't know everything about system, what ex-employee knew. 
**Say welcome to the new unexpected bugs :(**.

## Risks.
* Risk #0: missed deadlines.
* Risk #1: few times I've seen that the ex-employee drags colleagues along to the new company.
* Risk #2: the new employee won't be accepted by the team.
* Risk #3: the new employee won't accelerate to the same pace as ex-employee did.
* Risk #4: the new employee may not like the project/management/team and leave in a few months or a year,
and the company is back to square 1.

## Questions Of The Day.
* Will the new employee demand less compensation? 
  
* Why not just promote the ex-employee then? :thinking-face:
