## Background of ~~friends~~ students

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 of 5 were not familial with IT at all. The rest 2 studied some basics in Universities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 of 5 had Intermediate level of English. The rest 2 spoke no English.

Name | Age | Education | English 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Maxim | 21 | Bachelor's in Computer Sc. | intermediate
Artem | 22 | Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering | intermediate
Andrey | 22 | Bachelor's in System Analysis | intermediate
Dmitriy | 22 | 4th year student (History) | not found
Michail | 20 | 4th year student (Mechanical Engineering) | not found

## Timing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are lots of criteria for boosting the search, and most important one is
<a target="_blank" href="/Learning-Multiple-Foreign-Languages">English level</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students were technically stronger with better English,
but it took them longer to find a job.
Definitely luck always plays role in
<a target="_blank" href="/How-To-Find-The-First-Job">finding first job</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On average the course took around 1 month of full time studying (200-300 hours).

## Which companies hired?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range of levels of companies is high - starting from small outsourcing, ending with a product used by millions.

Company | Type | Employees count
--- | --- | ---
[Ria](https://jobs.dou.ua/companies/ria/) | product | 200+
[SoftServe](https://jobs.dou.ua/companies/softserve/) | outsource/outstaff | 1500+
[Citrus](https://jobs.dou.ua/companies/citrus-ua/) | product | 1500+
[RinGames](https://jobs.dou.ua/companies/ringames/) | outsource | 20+
[Absolutist](https://jobs.dou.ua/companies/absolutist/) | product | 80+

## Roles QA/AQA/Developer

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of beginning of the course I was working as QA Automation Engineer,
so the program was mostly focused on preparing testers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Positions of students: 3 - Manual QA, 1 - QA Automation, 1 - Developer.

## Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results show that with proper motivation and desire anyone can
enter IT industry no matter which education and level of English they have.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All 5 students didn't know what to do with their University diplomas.
Around 5 years each of them spent studying school courses which did not lead them to
a desired well paid job.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In future I hope to update the tables with more people 
who found their new career path in IT.
