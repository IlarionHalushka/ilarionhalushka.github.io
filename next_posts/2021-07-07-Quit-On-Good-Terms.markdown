&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time has come for you to move on with your career and you are quiting your current job.
It's always good to leave on good terms as the earth is round. 
You never know where you will meet your colleagues in the future.

## My Rules:
* Try not to leave when a critical deadline is coming and the whole team depends on you. It's a sabotage.
* Don't say anything bad about the company/team/project/management.
* Talk about a better career opportunity and that you enjoyed working at current place.
* Try to finish the last tasks as good as possible.
* Praise your peers, let them know that you liked working together.
  

* If you did not enjoy working with someone - **Speech is silver, silence is golden** :)
* Share your knowledge with peers, preferably document it or even do the screen recordings.
* Connect with peers on linkedin.
* Thank your managers and peers.
* Try not to plant a seed in your peers' minds about leaving the company.
* Be honest.
 


**Don't muddy the water, tomorrow you may have to drink it.**
