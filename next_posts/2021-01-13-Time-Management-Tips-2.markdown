## Social Media Rules

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could argue that everyone should quit social media including myself, 
but let's face the reality - we are addicted, and it is new reality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can't fully fight the addiction, then at least we can try to control it:

* Set time limitations.
* Unsubscribe from bloggers, time-wasting video/photo memes.
* Hide apps from home screen. (move to the top left corner of the screen, put it inside the folder)
* Check updates (i.e. instagram stories) only once a day at the same time.
* Get your cellphone away from your bed when you sleep.
* Don't check social media first thing in the morning.
  

* Turn off the network whenever possible.
* Turn off the notifications.
* Turn on the silent mode.
* Ask your friends/family to call you only if they need you asap, 
  else let them know the specific time frame when you are available. 
  Trust me - they will adjust.
  My call me only before 10 am or after 19 pm, or just send a message asking to call them back when I am free.

## Books about Time Management I Recommend
* Atomic Habits. James Clear.
* Getting things done. David Allen.
* Eat That Frog! Brian Tracy.
* Tiny Habits. BJ Fogg.
* Release your brakes. James Newman.

## TODO List or Calendar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some say that Calendar is more effective than just a TODO list.
However, I found for myself that journal with TODO list for each day work perfectly for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a TODO list of same 23 items for every single day.
Some days it can get up to 50 items on the list for 1 day.

## Time Tracking Programs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toggl

* Helps to track time for any activity or project.
* There is a web and mobile apps.
* It has easy and usable interface for changing type of activity you are working on.
* I have been already tracking my time for 1 year in a row.
* Each week it sends reports about time spent.


**What doesn't bring you closer to your goal - doesn't matter.**
