&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that training the mind should be treated as a separate kind of sports and be taught at schools.
The sport where you don't compete with other people, but where you compete only with yourself.
The sport where there is no limit to your abilities.
The sport which affects every single aspect of your life.

## Method of a Physical Activity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you start thinking about something that make you sad or makes you worry, then immediately start doing push-ups or squats.
After some time your brain will block those negative thoughts, as brain will know that it will trigger your physical activity.
We all have inborn instinct to save energy, so brain will try to avoid those negative thoughts in order not to trigger push-ups or squats.

## Method of an Opposite Thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as you catch yourself thinking about things that make you sad or demotivate you, 
try to switch to something really positive.
This method requires practice like any physical activity.
The more times you try to "switch" to a positive thought, the easier it will become.

## Method of Keeping Self Busy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many things can you think of at the same time? Only one. 
You can't keep two thought processes on your mind. 
So keeping yourself busy with something, doesn't allow negative thoughts to progress.
When you just lie in your bed and nothing occupies your mind, it's more likely there is free space for negative thoughts.
