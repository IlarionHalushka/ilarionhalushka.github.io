I could never understand people who say that money don't matter.
Definitely it's not everything that one should be willing to have in life.
However that's definitely one thing that

Money is something that people believe in.
It's not necessarily dollar bills.

Money is security.

Money is freedom.

Money is time.

Money is stability.

Money is confidence.

Money is the amount of impact or value you make to this world.
This is your worth in this world.
(Considering money are earned in legal and conscientious way)

## What If EU/US Government Prints More Bills?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then money just lose their value. It's not a secret that if money don't work for you, every year
they lose their value by a few percents on inflation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

## Investing Money.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

* investing in your self - education, travelling, sports.
"Collect memories, not things."

## How Much Is Enough?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


## How Much Does Your Time Cost?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's say your goal is to earn 5000$ a months.
That means that 5_000$ / 500 hours awake = ~10$ an hour. That's how much your time costs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let's say you go out with friends 2 times a week for a few hours.
Cost: 8 days * 4 hours * 10$ = 320$.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooking every day for 2 hours: 30 days * 2 hours * 10$ = 600$.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surfing social media instagram/tiktok/youtube/facebook/telegram every day for 3 hours
(don't believe me? check your screen time ;)): 30 days * 3 hours * 10$ = 900$.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now calculate that for 1 year (52 weeks), 5 (260 weeks), 10, 20...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to earn 1_000_000$ a month then your time costs: 1_000_000$ / 500 hours awake = 2000$ an hour.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One may say that: "But, I don't earn that much money now.". The answer is simple -
if you continue to waste time on things which don't increase your income and don't bring you closer to your goal you will
always stay on same level of income.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So whatever you do just ask yourself **"Does this bring me closer to my goals?"**,
**"Is the activity I am spending time on worth it?"**, **"Am I working on improving myself and my earning ability?"**.
