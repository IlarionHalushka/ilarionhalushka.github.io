&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my career I have worked for oursource, product and startup companies. 

## What do I choose?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All company types can usually offer similar compensation and benefits.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider outsource/outstaff companies as 
**unnecessary layer between the developer and business owner**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Why should I give a part of my income to intermediate company**, 
if I can get hired directly by business? :thinking-face:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, 
I assume that for junior/middle engineers there is no better place for growing professionally as in outsource/outstaff companies.

## Product

#### Pros
* Why to give part of your salary to someone else if you can work directly on client (product).
* Less management above your shoulders
* Less bureaucracy
* More opportunities to grow into management
* Possibility of getting stocks/options
* Possibility of getting team lead/architect/cto positions
* Your meaning has more value
* If developers count gets cut, first ones to fire are outsource people
* More interesting tasks
* Closer to end clients
* Feeling of belonging
  
#### Cons
* Less possibility to change team or tech stack


## Outstaff
* there is possibility that you will work alone with the clientâ€™s team, and you will feel alone. 
  Outstaff company basically provides you with coworking space and takes part of your salary. 
  Considering that currently most of the companies hire remotely, 
  outstaff will just take part of your salary and handle all documentation routines for you.

## Outsource
* they usually win in family-like environment, organizing parties, team buildings. You can change projects and tech stack more often.
* There are different sizes of companies and projects. Be careful when deciding to work for a small outsource, most likely you will have to work on small projects, bad process, not defined requirements.
* Possibility of starting a project from scratch.

## Startup
* No stability. Big percentage of startups fail.
* Fast paced environment.
* Usually poor development process aimed at getting things done quickly.
* If Startup succeeds, and you are the one who is there from the beginning, you may get some benefits.
* Not much management above your head.
* Requires a decision making and taking responsibility.
