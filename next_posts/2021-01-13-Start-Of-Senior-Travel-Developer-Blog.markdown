## The Idea Of Mixing Entertainment and Education 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent times my friends and I often discuss topic of living our lives to the fullest
while we are still young and not obliged with family lives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The default idea for living life to the fullest is of course travelling. 
We all love to watch some youtubers who travel around the world exploring some known and unknown places.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand my friends including myself prefer to spend time productively:
watch youtube in x2 speed, watch less entertainment and more educational content.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day we discussed that there is not a single IT blogger who creates educational content
which is at the same time entertaining (e.g. with travelling). It's either boring educational videos 
with screen recordings or all those "Why should you become BlaBlaScript developer in 2021?" 
and "Which language to choose in 2021?" videos.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That discussion brought us to the idea of creating first IT blog which will help people
combine learning and entertainment. **No more boring educational videos.**


## Motivation. Why we got bored and started blog.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working as developer can get boring, especially when working from home. 
I often recall those good times when we had to go to school/university/office with nice atmosphere
of fun and collaboration. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some may say that it's a waste of time that we spend on commuting, 
goalless chats with colleagues, disturbing noises, 2 hours lunch breaks, etc. 
And I would agree, even though it's a double-edged sword.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway we got bored while working remotely and all this quarantine stuff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more reason to create a blog was the desire to spread the knowledge to more people.
As you may know I had taught 5 of my friends before I started youtube blog. 
I already had some sort of plan of education from scratch that worked with 100% success rate (5 of 5 students got offers).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently I was asked by a few of people if I would teach them as I taught others.
Thinking silently to myself I realised that it would be really boring explaining same basic stuff
multiple times. Why not just record it and then share it with the world? Whenever anyone asks for my help
I could just give them the link and set myself free from helping one person at a time :)

## Next Steps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In future we plan to record series of videos of how to become a Software Tester,
QA Automation, JavaScript Developer (BE, FE, Mobile), Java Developer. There will be also a common playlist
with Computer Sc. basics which are required for all specialities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the topics will be aimed at beginners who want to enter the industry.
We plan to cover topics from first line of code till getting first job and
developing skills.
