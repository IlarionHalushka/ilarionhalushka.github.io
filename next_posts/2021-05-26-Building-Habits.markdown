## Start Small. Tiny Habits.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiny habits add up and in a long term perspective make a huge impact on your results.

## Habit Stacking.

## Same Time+Place+Environment.

## Don't Think. Just Repeat.

## Never Miss Twice.
Even though, some days you have an emergency or feeling sick. 
Never miss two days in a row. Building a good habit is way much easier than breaking the loop and stop the sequence.

## Replace Bad Habits With Good Ones.
Getting rid of bad habits leads to building good habits.

## People Who Surround You.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Look around at the people you know, some are successful, some are not.
Try to notice the 5 people who surround them, and you will see the pattern. 
More successful people are usually surrounded with alike people. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same applies to building good habits. 
If your friends like to chill/hang/party, drink, smoke then most likely you will inherit their habits.
On the other hand, if your surrounding people like reading books, do sports, traveling, building companies, making money 
- guess what, you are more likely to follow the same way.
