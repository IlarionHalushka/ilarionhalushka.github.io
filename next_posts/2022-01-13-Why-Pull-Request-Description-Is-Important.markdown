Proves that your changes work.

Helps reviewers understand the context and therefore make a more thorough review and ask fewer questions.

Keeps history of changes, when someone does "git blame" on your code and they can check PR description for details.

If PR is abandoned for a while and you need to get back to it after a week or month. 

Other team members can pick up the work that you did if you switch project or leave on vacation.

No need to remember things. Free your mind.

Makes it easier to do a cherry-pick to release branch and get it approved by release engineers.
