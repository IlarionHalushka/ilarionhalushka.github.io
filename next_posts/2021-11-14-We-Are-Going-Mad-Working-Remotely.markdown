    Distancing from social life makes us slowly go mad. 
    It's a natural need for us to socialize and communicate with other people.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 
<a target="_blank" href="/How-Companies-Build-Trust-With-Employees">How Companies Build Trust With Employees</a> article
I already shared my thoughts regarding the need of people to belong to a group, to socialize.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet we are facing the new reality where the government puts restrictions on the social life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been four years since I started working remotely. 
I was
<a target="_blank" href="/Back-To-Office-Back-To-Reality">vising office </a>,
only a few times a month.
During these four years I evolved from 
**"I want to work 100% remote and will never want to get back to the office."**
to
**"OK, visiting office one or two times a week is what I need."**

## Social Creatures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever wondered why...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why you go to the cinema or bowling with your fiends?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why you loved playing team sports like soccer or volleyball when you were a kid?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you go to the concerts instead of watching them on the screen?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you travel abroad with your loved one or your friends, but never alone?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why go to the restaurant instead of ordering delivery?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not alone?


## Quarantine restrictions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not allowed to go out to meet other people, not allowed to travel.
Simply said - we are celled at ~~dungeon~~ home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion keeping people distant from each other may be
good in terms of reducing viruses spread, however not many people think of mental health consequences.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I start hearing about depression/anxiety/loneliness from more and more people. 
Feels like it's becoming a new epidemic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bet there is going to be a spike of mental health issues in society, 
if we continue to be celled at home.


## Rituals. Escaping from home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I talked to a few of my colleagues and friends about working from home for a long period of time.
Every one of them made up a reason to escape their home. They shared with me their rituals of socializing:

- My team lead's: go out to get a street food - shawarma.
- My brother's: go out to get a gallon of purified water.
- My friend's: go to the supermarket to buy milk.
- My: go to the caf√© for a croissant + late.


## Conclusion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the points above, actually 
<a target="_blank" href="/Back-To-Office-Back-To-Reality">vising office </a>
is not a bad idea. 
Probably not every day, but 2-3 times a week for socializing is the right balance.
