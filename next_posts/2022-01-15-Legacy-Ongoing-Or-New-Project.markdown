    I have experience of working with different kinds of projects.
    Most of them I mark as medium or fast paced.

Don't want to sound ageist, so I would just say that at some point of time
people start losing motivation as their hormones level drops.

Probably at this time it's good to join a project where you can chill and work only a
couple of hours.


Also when working a couple of hours a day, it's not a problem to find a second job.
Also supporting old project. Also a couple of hours a day.


No stress. No pushing.


Bad:
Say welcome to the comfort zone.

No development.

No career advancement, except of growing to Senior Debug Developer or the current project.

Development of [Impostor Syndrome]() where the IT world moves forward, but you stay behind.

Surrounded by non-ambitious peers, or ones who could not find a better job.
Remember, that we are an average of 5 people who we spend most of the time with.

Feeling useless. Writing only a few lines a day or even a week makes it feel like you 
do not do anything, you don't make any impact, don't add any value.
