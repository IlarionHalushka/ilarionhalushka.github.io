why do we always think that we will wake up tomorrow?

how many plans do we have for our future?

how much time is left?

if today was your last day and tomorrow was too late, would you say goodbye to yesterday? 

Why does it hurt when someone dies?

Why we think that all our relatives and friends will always be there?

Is it better to live longer but alone, or die younger?

Everyone wants to go to heaven, but no one wants to die.

Have you thought of how much inconvenience it will bring to your closest if you pass out?


Let's try to zoom out your life map.
Let's say you have 60 years of life.
First 20 years you study at school.
Then you get a job and for 10 years struggle to get a good career.
Now you are 30. It's time to start a family. 
Boom, you are 40, you still need to work full time to take care of your children.
Your children have grown. You are 50. 
Your health is not in the best condition and motivation level is as low as never before.

This picture of life map looks like you always lived for someone else.

Everyday single we think something like "when I finish school" / "when I get a job" / "when I marry" /
"when I have kids" / "when kids will grow" / "when I move to another city"

"then I will ..."

The cruel reality is that this "then I will" never comes.
Days turn into weeks, weeks into months and months into years.

We are like ships which cruise along with the wind.

What is the best time to start working on passion? 
What is the best time to start living your life the way you want to live it?

Today.
